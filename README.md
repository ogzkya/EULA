# EULA New Update 

Terms & Conditions
By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you-you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app.

You agree not to:

Use our service to send spam or scam users.
Promote violence or post illegal pornographic content.
Post content that is harassing, harmful, threatening, abusive, vulgar, obscene or otherwise objectionable.
You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong toInstamobile.io.

Instamobile.io is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

Instachatty app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We, therefore, recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Instachatty app won’t work properly or at all.

You should be aware that there are certain things that Instamobile.io will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Instamobile.io cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.

If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.

Along the same lines, Instamobile.io cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Instamobile.io cannot accept responsibility

With respect to Instamobile.io responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Instamobile.io accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.

At some point, we may wish to update the app. Instamobile.io does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.

Safety and Security
Report issues
We encourage you to report problematic content to us. Please keep in mind that to help ensure the safety, confidentiality, and security of your messages, we generally do not have the contents of messages available to us, which limits our ability to verify the report and take action.

Report

When you receive a message from an unknown number for the first time, you’ll have the option to report the number directly inside the chat.

Banning

We may remove accounts if we believe the account activity is in violation of our Terms and Conditions, we may retain the right to remove your account without notification. Please be aware that a user report of conduct in violation of our Terms and Conditions will not necessarily result in us removing the user or otherwise taking action against the user.

Please review the “Acceptable Use of Our Services” section of our Terms and Conditions carefully to learn more about the appropriate uses of Instachatty and the activities that violate our Terms and Conditions.

Spam and Hoaxes
We work diligently to reduce any spam messages that come through our system. Creating a safe space for users to communicate with one another is a priority. However, just like regular SMS or phone calls, it is possible for other Instachatty users who have your phone number to contact you. So, we want to help you identify and handle spam and hoax messages.

Spam and hoax messages may or may not come from one of your contacts. These types of messages spread false information and are designed to deceive you and prompt you to act in a certain way. If a message looks suspicious or sounds too good to be true, don’t tap on it, share it or forward it.

Watch out for messages that:

Include misspellings or grammatical mistakes
Ask you to tap on a link
Ask you to share your personal information (like credit card and bank account numbers, birthdate, passwords, etc.)
Ask you to click on a link to “activate” a new feature
Say that you have to pay to use Instachatty (Instachatty is a free app. We will never ask you to pay to use Instachatty and you do not have to do anything to use Instachatty for free.)
What to do

If you are receiving the message from an unknown number, you will be given the option to report the user to Instachatty as spam directly from the app.

If you’ve received spam from a contact, delete the message and do not click on any links or provide personal information. Tell the contact that the message they sent includes spam and point them to this Instachatty safety page.
